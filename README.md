## Chart Features
* **Visualize hierarchical data**: such as region-subregion-country-state, or organizational hierarchy, category-subcategory-product, etc
* **Size**: by some quantity, such as sales, budget, number of people, etc.
* **Heatmap**: colors can indicate position on a scale for a provided color measure, such as profit margin, % of budget remaining, average temperature, etc. Or, by default it will assign random colors to distinguish the tiles. See note.
* **Zoomable**: will support a hierarchy that you can drill down through. Zoom back out using the top bar (containing the drill down path).
* **Levels**: two levels of the hierarchy are displayed at once, but you can provide as many levels as you like, and zoom in.
* **Trimming**: when a tree branch contains repeating nodes, or when it reaches null, or otherwise becomes a single-node branch, it is trimmed. That way, users don't zoom in when there is no deeper data.
* **Tooltips**: customize to show dimension attribute value and all metric values.
